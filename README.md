## Features

- **Offline Search:** Utilize [`plocate`](https://plocate.sesse.net/) to perform fast, offline searches within your multimedia library.
- **Database Updates:** Automatically update the search database when new storage devices are connected.
- **Flexible Search:** Search across multiple databases stored in a designated directory.
- **Intuitive Interface:** Easy-to-use search interface within Kodi.
- **File Navigation:** Navigate to directories or play files directly from the search results.
- **Order by Size:** Option to sort search results by file size.
- **Color-Coded Results:** Different colors for directories and files in search results.

## Installation

1. **Download the Add-on:**
   - For **aarch64** architecture (tested on a Raspberry Pi): Download the `tools.plocate.search_aarch64_RPi4.zip` file from the [releases](https://github.com/plinkr/tools.plocate.search/releases/) section of this repository.
   - For **x86_64** architecture (PC, Intel NUC, Nettops, Virtual Machines and Laptops with x86 Hardware (64Bit)): Download the `tools.plocate.search_x86_64.zip` file from the [releases](https://github.com/plinkr/tools.plocate.search/releases/) section of this repository.

2. **Install via Kodi:**
   - Open Kodi and navigate to `Add-ons`.
   - Select `Install from zip file`.
   - Locate and select the downloaded `tools.plocate.search_<architecture>.zip` file.
   - Wait for the add-on installed notification.

3. **Post-Installation Script:**
   - The installation process will automatically run a script to copy and modify necessary `udev` rules.
   - It will also make the `update_index.sh` script executable.

## Usage

1. **Search for Files:**
   - Open the `plocate Search` add-on from the Kodi Add-ons menu.
   - Enter your search query in the dialog box.
   - The search results will be displayed, showing the file paths.

2. **Ordering Results by Size:**
   - After search results are displayed, an option to order by size in descending order will be available.
   - Select this option to sort the results by file size.

3. **Navigate or Play Files:**
   - Select a file to play it directly.
   - Select a directory to open it in the Kodi Videos file browser.

## Configuration

- **Search Options:**
  - You can configure various search options through the add-on settings in Kodi.
  - Modify options such as case-insensitive searches, regular expressions, basename searches, displaying the full path of the item or just the base file name and parent, for displaying conveniently less info, and searching only currently connected devices or including disconnected ones.

- **Index Management:**
  - The add-on automatically handles index updates for connected storage devices.
  - Indexes are stored in `/storage/.kodi/addons/tools.plocate.search/resources/databases/`.
  - Each index is named after the UUID of the storage device partition, ensuring uniqueness for every drive you connect to your LibreELEC device.

## Dependencies

- **plocate:** plocate is a `locate` based on posting lists, completely replacing `mlocate` with a much faster (and smaller) index.
- **updatedb:** Utility to update the database used by `plocate`.
- **LibreELEC:** Built for LibreELEC 12.0.1 and depends on the `udev` rules at `/storage/.config/udev.rules.d/95-udevil-mount.rules` to index newly connected devices.

## Binaries Release

The `plocate` and `updatedb` binaries (version `1.2.23`) are now compiled automatically by GitHub Actions for both **x86_64** and **aarch64** architectures. You can inspect the compilation workflow in [.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml](https://github.com/plinkr/tools.plocate.search/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-and-release.ymlhttps://github.com/plinkr/tools.plocate.search/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml) to see how the source is fetched, patched, built, and packaged into a release on every new version tag push.

These binaries are compatible with **LibreELEC 12.0.1** and have been tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 (aarch64) and a virtual machine running on a Linux box (x86_64).

### Additional Information

- **Automatic Database Updates:**
  - When a new storage device is connected, the add-on detects the device and runs `updatedb` to update the search index. It uses a custom `udev` rule at `/storage/.config/udev.rules.d/95-udevil-mount.rules` to run the script that updates the index for that partition, in the background using `/usr/bin/systemd-run --on-active=1` so it doesn't affect the normal operation of `udevil`.
  - The index is named using the UUID of the connected device partition to ensure uniqueness.

- **Efficient Search:**
  - By combining multiple `.db` files, searches span across all connected and previously indexed storage devices.
  - This ensures comprehensive search results for your entire multimedia library.

### Example Usage and Performance

Developed on a Raspberry Pi 4 with **LibreELEC 12.0.1** and **Kodi 21.1.0**, `plocate` indexes a 5TB external drive containing 17,502 multimedia files in about 12 seconds on a cold start, when no database is present and the entire disk must be scanned (i.e., the worst-case scenario). 
```
LibreELEC:~ # time /storage/.kodi/addons/tools.plocate.search/resources/lib/updatedb --database-root /var/media/easystore/ --output /storage/plinkr/plocate/plocate.db
real 0m 12.10s
user 0m 0.64s
sys 0m 0.23s
```

Subsequent runs are faster, taking less than 1 second (depending on file changes):
```
LibreELEC:~ # time /storage/.kodi/addons/tools.plocate.search/resources/lib/updatedb --database-root /var/media/easystore/ --output /storage/plinkr/plocate/plocate.db
real 0m 0.77s
user 0m 0.54s
sys 0m 0.23s
```

### Development Notes

This addâ€‘on is stable and I use it on a daily basis. If you'd like to request a new feature or report an issue, please open one in this repository's [Issues](https://github.com/plinkr/tools.plocate.search/issues).

It uses a modified version of `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/95-udevil-mount.rules` copied to `/storage/.config/udev.rules.d/95-udevil-mount.rules` to run `updatedb` and create the index for the connected device after it has been mounted by `udevil`. The script runs in the background to avoid interfering with normal operations. 

The add-on for Kodi returns search results and allows you to open directories or play media files directly. Configuration options enable various `plocate` behaviors, such as case-insensitive searches, regular expressions, basename searches, and searching only currently connected devices or including disconnected ones. This last option is useful if you want to find some file on a disk that you had previously connected, but you are unsure on what drive it is.

Currently, there is an issue deleting the `/storage/.config/udev.rules.d/95-udevil-mount.rules` file after uninstalling, so if you uninstall the add-on, please delete the file by hand. You can do so from the shell:
```
LibreELEC:~ # rm /storage/.config/udev.rules.d/95-udevil-mount.rules
```

### TODO
- Make `plocate` a LibreELEC add-on, so it can support all its platforms.
- Document how to compile `plocate` for LibreELEC on any architecture, by following the existing GitHub Actions workflow as a template.
- Add an option to rebuild the index of any connected device from the configuration, on demand.
- Find a way to clean up custom `udev` rules after uninstallation.

For more details, please refer to the source code within this repository.
